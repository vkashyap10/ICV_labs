Question 3: When normalising the histograms, the sum of all values across the bins should be 1

yes you can use pyplot.bar

Can you clarify 'colour histogram'? Separate RGB channel histogram or mixed colour histogram?
@Julian - re: histo - it's your choice, then discuss

In critical report. Tell what you tried and why and the results. Any decisions you had to take.
